# Project Description
A brief project description can be found [here](README.md).

# Architecture Decision Records
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are stored in the [docs/ADRs](docs/ADRs) directory. Strictly follow the template [here](docs/ADRs/xxx_template.md) when creating new ADRs. Do not modify existing ADRs unless explicitly asked to do so. Always create an ADR when making a significant architectural decision.

## Frontend technologies
For the frontend, use Next.js (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MDX. A detailed ADR can be found [here](docs/ADRs/001_frontend_tech_stack.md).

## DevOps foundation
For the DevOps foundation, use Docker and GitHub Actions. A detailed ADR can be found [here](docs/ADRs/002_devops_foundation.md).

# Project Architecture
The project architecture is documented in the [docs/architecture](docs/architecture) directory. Always refer to the architecture documentation when making changes to the project structure or code.
